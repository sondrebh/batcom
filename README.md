## Exercise

Create a product page for an e-commerce website. You have free reign with the layout and general look of the page, but we require you to have these sections / elements on the page:

* A header containing:
    * Company logo,
    * Search field
    * Some kind of shopping cart status / indicator
    * Category navigation
* Page content containing:
    * Product image(s)
    * "Add to cart"-button
    * Product price
    * Additional product information
* Footer containing:
    * Links to typical CMS pages
    * Social share links
    * A newsletter signup element
* Different sections and elements can be as simple or as complex as you prefer
* Links are allowed to be "dead"
* Go flashy or go conservative, your choice! But consider usability and "conversion" when creating the layout and placing the different types of elements

### The exercise will be evaluated according to the following:

* HTML code quality
* CSS / SCSS / SASS code quality
* JavaScript code quality
* Making use of existing open source packages and libraries
* Responsive web design - does the app scale well on all devices

### Extra credit:

* Use PHP for dynamic content
